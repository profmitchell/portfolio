# Getting Started with Synthesis

Sound synthesis is the foundation of modern electronic music production. Let's explore the basics of creating sounds from scratch.

## Understanding Oscillators

The oscillator is the heart of any synthesizer. It generates the basic waveforms:

- Sine wave: Pure, fundamental tone
- Square wave: Rich in harmonics, hollow sound
- Sawtooth: Bright and buzzy
- Triangle: Soft and mellow

## Basic Parameters

### 1. Amplitude Envelope (ADSR)

- Attack: Time to reach full volume
- Decay: Time to reach sustain level
- Sustain: Level while key is held
- Release: Time to silence after key release

### 2. Filter

- Cutoff: Frequency threshold
- Resonance: Emphasis at cutoff
- Envelope: Modulation over time

### 3. LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator)

- Rate: Speed of modulation
- Depth: Amount of effect
- Waveform: Shape of modulation

## First Steps

1. Start with a simple waveform
2. Shape with the envelope
3. Apply filtering
4. Add modulation
5. Experiment and refine

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a basic bass sound
2. Design a pad sound
3. Make a pluck sound
4. Experiment with modulation
